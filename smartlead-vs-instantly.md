|-----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|

- **Analysis**: **Smartlead.ai** offers better value with more contacts and emails for similar prices, especially at the entry and mid-tier levels. For example, its Basic Plan ($39/month) provides 2,000 leads and 6,000 emails vs. Instantly.ai’s 1,000 contacts and 5,000 emails for $37/month. Annually, Smartlead.ai is slightly more expensive ($390 vs. $360), but the additional capacity may justify the cost for agencies managing larger lists.

#### Agency-Specific Features

For an automation agency, managing multiple clients is essential, and both platforms cater to this need, but with different approaches.

- **Instantly.ai**: Suitable for agencies, as evidenced by testimonials like “Cancelled all other email sending accounts. We're now using Instantly for all of our and our clients' campaigns” ([Instantly.ai Review](https://instantly.ai)). It allows unlimited email accounts, which is useful for client management, but lacks explicit features like white-labeling or sub-accounts. The Custom Plan includes dedicated account managers and a private deliverability network, which could support agency needs.

- **Smartlead.ai**: Explicitly designed for agencies, offering full white-label experience (e.g., app.yourdomain.com), branded client portals for clients to access reports and campaigns, and sub-accounts for managing multiple clients. Testimonials highlight its suitability, such as “A must-have tool for any B2B agency!” ([Smartlead.ai Testimonials](https://www.smartlead.ai/)). These features make it ideal for professional agency operations.

**Comparison**: **Smartlead.ai** is more agency-friendly with specialized tools, while **Instantly.ai** is used by agencies but lacks these explicit features, potentially requiring more manual management.

#### Deliverability and Compliance

Deliverability is critical for cold email success, and both platforms prioritize it, but with notable differences.

- **Instantly.ai**: Emphasizes a dedicated deliverability network with tools like SISR, which assigns dedicated servers and IPs to maintain high rates, swapping flagged IPs immediately. Users report high deliverability, but some mention issues with inaccurate lead data leading to higher bounce rates ([Instantly vs Smartlead: Comparing Top Lead Generation Tools](https://www.growleady.io/tools/instantly-vs-smartlead)). It allows purchasing sending domains with full setup (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC), ensuring better control.

- **Smartlead.ai**: Offers high-deliverability IP servers, dynamic ESP matching, and real-time AI learning, with unlimited warmups and auto-rotation. However, its warm-up feature is not compliant with Google’s standards, raising concerns for Gmail users, as noted in reviews ([Smartlead vs Instantly: Decoding Giants](https://www.gocustomer.ai/blog/smartlead-vs-instantly)). Despite this, users praise its warmup efficiency for non-Gmail setups.

**Comparison**: **Instantly.ai** has a stronger deliverability focus, especially for Gmail, due to compliance and domain setup options. **Smartlead.ai**’s deliverability is robust but may face limitations with Gmail, which could be a concern for your agency depending on client email providers.

#### Scalability and Growth

Both platforms are designed for scalability, allowing unlimited email accounts with auto-rotation.

- **Instantly.ai**: Scales well with higher plans, offering 25,000 contacts and 100,000 emails/month in Hyper Growth, and 100,000+ contacts in Custom. However, entry-level plans have lower limits (1,000 contacts, 5,000 emails).

- **Smartlead.ai**: Offers higher limits out of the box, with Basic Plan at 2,000 leads and 6,000 emails, Pro at 30,000 leads and 150,000 emails, and Custom up to 12 million leads and 60 million emails. This makes it more scalable for growing agencies.

**Comparison**: **Smartlead.ai** provides better scalability with higher standard plan limits, while **Instantly.ai** requires upgrading to Custom for similar capacity.

#### User Experience and Support

- **Instantly.ai**: Known for a simpler, intuitive interface, ideal for new users. Growth Plan includes chat and live chat support, with access to a private Facebook community for additional help. However, some users note limited integrations with third-party tools ([Instantly vs Smartlead: Which Is The Right Sales Tool](https://reply.io/blog/instantly-vs-smartlead/)).

- **Smartlead.ai**: Offers a comprehensive interface with advanced features, potentially with a steeper learning curve. Basic Plan provides general support within 24 hours, Pro Plan includes active support, and it’s known for responsive customer service. Users appreciate its community and agency-focused support ([Smartlead.ai Review](https://smartreach.io/blog/smartlead-ai-review/)).

**Comparison**: **Instantly.ai** is easier for beginners, while **Smartlead.ai** offers more advanced features with strong support, suitable for agencies willing to invest time in learning.

#### Recommendation and Considerations

Based on your needs as a new automation agency, **Smartlead.ai** is recommended due to:
- **Better Value for Agencies**: Offers more contacts and emails for similar prices, crucial for managing multiple clients (e.g., Basic Plan at $39/month vs. Instantly.ai’s $37/month, with 2,000 vs. 1,000 contacts).
- **Agency-Specific Features**: White-labeling, sub-accounts, and branded client portals are ideal for professional agency operations, enhancing client management.
- **Scalability**: Higher limits in standard plans allow for growth without immediate upgrades.
- **Multi-Channel Outreach**: Supports email, SMS, Twitter, and WhatsApp, providing flexibility for future strategies.

However, consider the following:
- **Deliverability Concern**: Smartlead.ai’s Google non-compliance may affect Gmail users. If your agency relies heavily on Gmail, test deliverability during the 14-day free trial. Its other tools (high-deliverability IP servers) may mitigate issues for non-Gmail setups.
- **Learning Curve**: Its comprehensive interface may require more time to master compared to Instantly.ai’s simpler setup.

If deliverability is your top priority and you’re concerned about Gmail compliance, **Instantly.ai** could be a better fit, especially with its “Start for Free” option for testing. However, its lower contact and email limits in basic plans may require upgrading sooner as your agency grows.

Both platforms offer free trials, so I recommend testing each to see which aligns better with your workflow and client needs as of April 14, 2025.
